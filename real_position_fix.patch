# This patch fixes the position update system to show real robot positions
# and last known position when disconnected

# 1. Replace demo position data with real robot position queries
# 2. Always start status loop to show last known position when disconnected
# 3. Store last known good position data

--- a/src/control/jog_controller.py
+++ b/src/control/jog_controller.py
# The status loop should:
# - When connected: Query real robot position and update displays
# - When disconnected: Continue showing last known position (no updates)
