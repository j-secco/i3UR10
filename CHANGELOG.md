## Technical Decisions Log

### 2025-09-23: Communication Protocol Selection
- **Decision**: Use WebSocket as primary communication method
- **Rationale**: 
  - Excellent for real-time bidirectional communication
  - Lower overhead compared to traditional HTTP
  - Great compatibility with modern Python libraries
  - Better for event-driven architecture
  - More suitable for dynamic UI updates on touchscreen
- **Alternatives considered**: RTDE (Real-Time Data Exchange)
- **References**: Universal Robots Socket Communication documentation

### 2025-09-23: UI Framework Selection  
- **Decision**: PyQt6 for touchscreen interface
- **Rationale**:
  - Already available in target environment (v6.6.1)
  - Excellent touch support and customization options
  - Cross-platform compatibility
  - Rich widget library for industrial applications
- **Target hardware**: Elo i3 touchscreen device

### 2025-09-23: Project Architecture
- **Decision**: Modular Python-based architecture
- **Structure**:
  ```
  src/
  ├── communication/  # WebSocket interfaces
  ├── control/        # Jog control logic
  ├── ui/             # PyQt6 user interface
  └── utils/          # Helper functions
  ```
- **Benefits**: Clear separation of concerns, testability, maintainability

## Dependencies

### Current
- Python 3.12.3+
- PyQt6 6.6.1
- websockets (Python library for WebSocket communication)
- PyYAML (for configuration)

### Future Considerations
- Logging framework integration
- Testing framework setup
- Packaging and distribution tools

## Notes

This project is developed specifically for Universal Robots UR10 with focus on:
- Industrial touchscreen operation
- Real-time robot control via WebSockets
- Safety-first design approach
- Maintainable and extensible architecture

All development follows Universal Robots official documentation and best practices.
